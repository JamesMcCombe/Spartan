hi there, i need you to help me with my project SPARTAN. this project is an analysis based crypto trading tool, that performs deep analysis on solana meme coins in order to find and indentify repeat token creators who generate many tokens that then behave the same way, probably because of artificially pumped transactions that they orchastrate to a set pump percentage, and then they dump their token holdings, so that they can keep the organic profit they attract from other investors. my plan is to indentify the signature of these schemers tokens by programatically analyzing their token pattern behavior, isolating the creators that have a set signature and then getting in and out of trades before the token hits that creators pump trigger to dump the coin.


Updated Proposed Workflow (Detailed)
Step 1: Scan Tokens:
Runs scan_tokens.py → pump_tokens_*.json.
No change needed.
Step 2: Inspect and Filter Creators:
Modify inspect_repeat_creators.py:
Load all_trade_creators.json.
For each token, get creator via get_token_meta.
If creator exists, compare token created_time to max created_time in token_trades.
Output:
new_creator_analysis_*.json: New creators or new tokens.
known_tokens_*.json: Tokens already in DB.
Step 3: Bulk Token Analysis:
Runs on new_creator_analysis_*.json.
No major change, just processes new tokens.
Step 4: Rank Creators:
Ranks based on new_creator_analysis_*.json.
No change.
Step 5: Bulk Deep Creator Analysis:
Modify bulk_deep_creator_analysis.py:
In fetch_creator_pumpfun_tokens, add block_time[]=[max_created_time+1, now].
Process only new tokens.
Output: deep_creator_analysis_*.json.
Step 6: Bulk Optimization Strategy:
Modify bulk_optimization_strategy.py:
Load all_trade_creators.json and known_tokens_*.json.
Merge new analyses with existing token_trades.
Optimize and update all_trade_creators.json.
Step 7: Re-optimization:
Runs as is on flagged creators.

Discussion
Efficiency: This cuts out redundant Solscan calls in Step 5 by filtering early in Step 2.
Precision: Using created_time ensures we catch all new tokens within the day.
Flexibility: Works with your multiple daily scans by always checking the latest timestamp.

Note: Block_time[] is depricated so we will not use it in the new code. Instead we will use from_time and to_time. Here is the information about the parameters after i performed a test:
Test Results Analysis
Time Range:
from_time=1743504851 (2025-04-01 23:54:11 UTC)
to_time=1743591251 (2025-04-02 23:54:11 UTC)
This is a 24-hour window, as intended.
Transfers Fetched: 100 transfers (likely hitting the page_size=50 limit, but the script fetched two pages or Solscan returned more—either way, it’s working).
Block Times:
Earliest: 1743589700 (2025-04-02 23:28:20 UTC)
Latest: 1743590115 (2025-04-02 23:35:15 UTC)
All fall within the 24-hour range, confirming the filter works.
Success: The API respected from_time and to_time, returning only transfers within the specified window.
This validates that we can use from_time and to_time in fetch_creator_pumpfun_tokens to fetch only new tokens, avoiding redundant data pulls. We’re good to proceed!
